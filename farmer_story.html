    <h3>The story</h3>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p>
    <p>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
    <p>They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></p>
    <p>The farmer said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
    <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
        said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q></p>
    <p>The farmer again said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
        leg.</p>
    <p>The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
        son because he had a broken leg.</p>
    <p>Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>

    <blockquote><p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
        impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you
        never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
        not
        make a big deal out of it...</p>
